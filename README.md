# Pycodoc

A documentation reading tool developed by an idiot. Probably it won't ever be finished because zeal does a good enough job. Still I think this project could bring some new things to the table, mainly in adding your documentation easily from local git repos (which is mainly in markdown and normally end up all over your system), and in having a friendly(er) interface.

Still it would be cool to have the zeal documentation stack integrated with this. You should really try zeal instead of this, if you are planning on having loads of *oficial* documentation
